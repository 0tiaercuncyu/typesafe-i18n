## What is Madrix LED Software?
 
Madrix LED Software is a software application that allows you to control LED lighting devices using various industry standards, such as DMX512, Art-Net, sACN, DVI, and more. You can connect to a wide range of LEDs and compatible controllers, and position them according to your needs in any shape or form. You can also map pixel by pixel and achieve pixel-perfect results, even with low-resolution LEDs.
 
Madrix LED Software is not only a LED lighting controller, but also a tool for generative visuals and effects. You can use it as a VJ software, a 2D pixel mapper, a 3D voxel mapper, a media server, or a media creator. You can choose from hundreds of built-in effects, or create your own using the powerful scripting engine. You can also sync your visuals to music using the audio analysis feature.
 
Madrix LED Software is made in Germany and has been a leading LED lighting controller since 2005. It has won several awards for its innovative features and user-friendly interface. It is suitable for any project size, from small installations to large-scale shows. It can drive tens of thousands of LEDs without problems and produce a complete LED light show from a normal computer or laptop.
 
## How to use Madrix LED Software for 2D pixel mapping?
 
2D pixel mapping is one of the most common applications of Madrix LED Software. It allows you to control any 2D LED display in every possible way. You can create stunning visuals using the built-in effects or your own media files. You can also map your LEDs to any shape or surface using the flexible patch editor.
 
To use Madrix LED Software for 2D pixel mapping, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Connect your LEDs and controllers to your computer using the appropriate protocol and hardware interface.
2. Launch Madrix LED Software and create a new project.
3. Go to the Patch tab and add your LEDs using the Device Manager. You can choose from a list of supported devices or create your own custom device.
4. Arrange your LEDs on the virtual patch area using the mouse or keyboard shortcuts. You can also use the alignment tools or import a layout file.
5. Go to the Setup tab and configure your output settings. You can choose the output protocol, IP address, port number, universe size, frame rate, and more.
6. Go to the Main tab and start creating your visuals. You can use the two decks and the crossfader to mix different effects or media files. You can also use the three previews to see your effects in advance.
7. Save your project and enjoy your 2D pixel mapping show!

## How to use Madrix LED Software for 3D voxel mapping?
 
3D voxel mapping is another exciting application of Madrix LED Software. It allows you to control real 3D LED matrices using volume rendering. This approach is different from the 3D projections or the physical layout of 2D surface areas that are widely known nowadays. It makes your installation state-of-the-art and creates amazing depth effects.
 
To use Madrix LED Software for 3D voxel mapping, you need to follow these steps:

1. Connect your LEDs and controllers to your computer using the appropriate protocol and hardware interface.
2. Launch Madrix LED Software and create a new project.
3. Go to the Patch tab and add your LEDs using the Device Manager. You can choose from a list of supported devices or create your own custom device.
